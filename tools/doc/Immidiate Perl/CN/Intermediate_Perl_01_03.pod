1.3. What’s with the Exercises?
1.3. 关于练习
Hands-on training gets the job done better. The best way to provide this training is with a series of exercises after every half-hour to hour of presentation. Of course, if you’re a speed reader, the end of the chapter may come a bit sooner than a half hour. Slow down, take a breather, and do the exercises!
动口又动手，学习就是好。 培训最好的途径就是在半小时或一小时之后的讲课后有一系列的练习。 当然，如果你阅读速度很快的话，一章大概在半小时之内就可以看完。那么，停一停，不着急，做一下练习吧。
Each exercise has a "minutes to complete" rating. We intend for this rating to hit the midpoint of the bell curve, but don’t feel bad if you take significantly longer or shorter. Sometimes it’s just a matter of how many times you’ve faced similar programming tasks in your studies or jobs. Use the numbers merely as a guideline.
每个练习都有限时。 我们打算取一个平均的解题速度，但是，如果你用了更长的时间，也不必但心。有时候这不过取决于在工作或学习中面对同样问题的次数。 只要把限时当作指导性的就可以了。
Every exercise has its answer in the Appendix. Again, try not to peek; you’ll ruin the value of the exercise.
每个练习在附录都有参考答案。再提醒一下，作题前别去看，看了再作题，学习效果就差了。
