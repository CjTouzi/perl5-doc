=EN A More Typical Object-Oriented Module: Math::BigInt
=CN 一个更典型的面向对象模块: Math::BigInt
=EN So as not to get dismayed about how "un-OO" the File::Spec module seems since it doesn't have objects, let's look at yet another core module, Math::BigInt, which can handle integers beyond Perl's native reach.
=CN 不要因为File::Spec模块没有任何对象, 所以看上去比较像"非面对象的"的模块而失望. 让我们看一下另外一个核心模块, Math::BigInt, 它用来处理超出Perl内置精度的整数值. [*]
=EN Behind the scenes, Perl is limited by the architecture it's on.
=CN 在幕后, Perl实际上要被其宿主的操作系统架构所限制.
=EN It's one of the few places where the hardware shows through. 
=CN 这是少数硬件环境限制之一. 
=EN start with 2
=CN 起始为 2
=EN take 2**1000
=CN 算2**1000
=EN print it out
=CN 输出结果
=EN As before, this module imports nothing.
=CN 如前所述, 这个模块没有导入任何东西. 
=EN Its entire interface uses class methods, such as new, against the class name to create instances, and then calls instance methods, such as bpow and bstr, against those instances. 
=CN 其全部的接口使用对象的方法, 如用new跟在类名之后, 来建立实例. 然后调用实例的方法, 如跟在实例名字后的bpow和bstr.
