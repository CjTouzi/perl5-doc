=EN What About All Those Footnotes
=CN 那些脚注是怎么回事
=EN Like Learning Perl, this book relegates some of the more esoteric items out of the way for the first reading and places those items in footnotes. 
=CN 同 B<Learning Perl> 这本书的做法一样, 我们把那些深奥的概念移掉了, 并把他们做为脚注. 
=EN You should skip those the first time through and pick them up on a rereading. 
=CN 在你第一次读本书的时候尽可以略过不看, 在重读的时候可以把它们看看. 
=EN You will not find anything in a footnote that you'll need to understand any of the material we present later. 
=CN 我们在以后提供给你的材料中不会涉及对这些脚注的理解. 
=EN Like this. 
=CN 喏, 就像这样.
