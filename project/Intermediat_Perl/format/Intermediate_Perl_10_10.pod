=EN Exercise 1 [25 min]
=CN 练习1 [25分钟]
=EN The Oogaboogoo natives on the island have unusual names for the days and months. Here is some simple but not very well-written code from Gilligan. Fix it up, add a conversion function for the month names, and make the whole thing into a library. For extra credit, add suitable error checking and consider what should be in the documentation. 
=CN 岛上的土著Oogaboogoo对于日期和月份着不同寻常的名字. 这里有个从Gilligan来的简单但写得不是很好的代码. 修改一下, 给月份名加一个对话函数, 并把这些放到一个库里. 为了更好的可靠性, 添加一个错误检查程序以及文档. 
@day = qw(ark dip wap sen pop sep kir);
sub number_to_day_name { my $num = shift @_; $day[$num]; }
@month = qw(diz pod bod rod sip wax lin sen kun fiz nap dep);
=EN Exercise 2 [15 min]
=CN 练习2 [15分钟]
=EN Make a program that uses your library and the following code to print out a message, such as Today is dip, sen 15, 2011, meaning that today is a Monday in August. (Hint: the year and month numbers returned by localtime may not be what you'd expect, so you need to check the documentation. )
=CN 写个程序使用你的库并用如下代码打印一些信息, 如今天是dip, sen 15, 2011, 表示今天是八月的周一. （暗示：localtime返回的年月数字可能并不一定是你想要的, 所以你要查一下文档. ）
my($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year, $wday) = localtime;
